# Web Scraper

Used Python's **Beautiful Soup** to parse HTML of a user-inputted product from Newegg, MicroCenter, and MemoryExpress. Scraped the data of all products matching the inputted product name and sorted them in lowest to highest price order. Returned the sorted products in an Excel file using the Python **Openpyxl** library. Included the name, link, and price of the product, as well as the total number of products found and the average price of all the products.
